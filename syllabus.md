# Intro

# The critical need for math
- Our education system is failing math skills are at all time lows
- Math is at the base of all sciences and governance 
- Our ability to collect and interpret data is at the base of all our decisions

# The need for a tutor
> Tutored over 100 engineers, scientists, and developers
- 1 on 1 long term mentoring is the best way to learn
- only 7 - 10% of students succeed with videos and books online
- this goes up to 70 - 90% with a tutor
- tailored for non-neurotypical students
- specifically for students with trouble reading and writing

# How does it work
- Poject based 1 on 1 tutoring
- Peer to peer encrypted mesh network
- Drastically reduces data and development costs
- Audio Video and text chat
- Image and file sharing
- Screen sharing
- Publishing platform
- Learners replicate the content they use and strengthen the network

# The technology landscape shifted
> Leveraging my time building a video systems for ed-tech
- In the last few years some amazing technologies have been developed
- Much better audio and video quality

# The opportunity

### The New Learning Economy: It’s Time To Build in Education
by Anne Lee Skates

> As we enter the third school year of the Covid era, a disturbing new normal is settling over the country. Students continue to be chronically absent; nearly 50,000 Los Angeles public school students failed to show up on the first day of school. Nine-year-olds’ math and reading levels have dropped to 20-year lows, and the dip in reading scores is the steepest decline in more than 30 years. Teacher vacancies are reaching crisis levels. Schools are even resorting to bringing back retirees and loosening basic teaching requirements to fill gaps. 

> Why is this so important? Education is a $1.8 trillion-dollar industry in the U.S. More importantly, our education system shapes who our future leaders and builders will be—more than 1 in 5 people in the U.S. are current K–12 and college students.
